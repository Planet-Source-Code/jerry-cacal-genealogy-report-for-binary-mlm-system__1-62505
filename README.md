### Description

This is a genealogy report generation for a binary structured multi-level marketing system.

The report is in listview, but stored in an array. The program is a little slow but there are

other ways to process the report faster. The program took 1 min. to process 678 members

(at 31 levels). It will work a lot slower if the all the nodes in the binary tree is full

(have 2 downlines each).

This program is dedicated to Ms. Sheryl L. Taripe. 2 (,") (",) 28
